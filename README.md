# Lost in Transmission: The Wave Equation, Transmission Lines, and Impedance Matching
Olin College Linearity II FA18 Final Project, Alison Palmer and Anusha Datar.

This project was mainly an exploration into the mathematics and physical concepts associated with the wave equation, telegrapher's equations, characteristic impedance, and transmission lines. Along with a [paper](https://anushadatar.github.io/lost-in-transmission/Lin_II_Final.pdf), we created an antenna analysis [circuit](https://anushadatar.github.io/lost-in-transmission/impedance_matching/circuit_diagram.jpg), Arduino [code](https://anushadatar.github.io/lost-in-transmission/impedance_matching/run_analyzer.ino) and a Mathematica [notebook](https://github.com/anushadatar/lost-in-transmission/blob/master/mathematica/Waves.nb).
